# JEFFnet version 0.1.3

Currently just basically a rust rewrite of Cat Nuke Thing, with a few fun extra features I thought might be handy. 

## TODO:
- [x] Nation spec categoriser - DONE v0.1.2
- [x] Setup bash script - DONE v0.1.2
- [x] Userscript - DONE v0.1.3
- [ ] Containerise stuff
- [ ] Any other suggestions, additional features

The repo is only really public so the other tech folk can look at it, but I'm open to taking it private or accepting any pull requests if this is deemed worthy of continuing.
