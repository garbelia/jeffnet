JEFFnet initial version 0.1.

Currently just basically a rust rewrite of Cat Nuke Thing, minus anything that interacts with NS directly, any of the userscript stuff, or the containerise stuff. Those will come later.

TODO:
- Nation spec categoriser
- Setup bash script
- Userscript
- Containerise stuff
- Any other suggestions, additional features
- Tweak the sheet so it isn't literally an exact copy of cat nuke thing

The repo is only really public so the other tech folk can look at it, but I'm open to taking it private or accepting any pull requests if this is deemed worthy of continuing.
