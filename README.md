JEFFnet initial version 0.1.

Currently just basically a rust rewrite of Cat Nuke Thing, minus anything that interacts with NS directly, any of the userscript stuff, or the containerise stuff. Those will come later.

TODO:
- Nation spec categoriser
- Setup bash script
- Userscript
- Containerise stuff
- Any other suggestions, additional features
- Tweak the sheet so it isn't literally an exact copy of cat nuke thing
